# Brief explanation

This plugin is for testing purposes alone!

If you have created your own unique mob abilities then please feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to.

Mob AI has ```infinite possibilities``` :smile:

You can change the item they hold

They're name, for exmple

```php
  public function getName(){
    return "BossSkeleton";
}
```

And by renaming the boss mob .php data folder to the name specified!

You can set the mobs speed as well as gravity with drag!

This is kind of like addons for ```0.16.0``` but the MCPE server version and with a bit more difficulty in the understanding portion.

You can also make your custom mob sit with just a few coded modifications!

For example you can use onUpdate with the mob and have it read the time in which it is standing on a specific block or  ```onGround```!
